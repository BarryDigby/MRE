# Review of MRE prediction in circRNAs
Before developing the circRNA-miRNA module of the [nextflow pipeline](https://github.com/BarryDigby/circrna), a thorough review of how databases and existing tools annotate circRNA miRNA reponse elements (MREs) must be conducted. This will be done by 'reverse engineering', available annotations will be downloaded and visualised and documentation tracked. Common themes will be noted, if there are major discrepancies then the authors of papers/tools will be contacted. 

My own questions that I intend to address:
* circRNAs are detected via BSJ in sequencing data, providing the span of the circRNA.
